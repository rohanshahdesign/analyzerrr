# Product Requirements Document: Privacy Guard Extension

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Privacy Guard Chrome extension. This extension is designed to assess the privacy practices of websites by analyzing their privacy policies and providing users with a clear, concise, and actionable risk assessment.

## 2. Product Overview

Privacy Guard is a tool for empowers users to make informed decisions about their online privacy. It automatically detects and analyzes a website's privacy policy, presenting a risk score and a summary of potential concerns in a user-friendly interface.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Privacy Policy Detection
- The extension must actively search for and locate the website's privacy policy. If a link is not present on the current page, the extension should intelligently crawl the website (e.g., check the footer of the homepage) to find it.

### 3.2. Privacy Policy Analysis
- The extension will scrape and analyze the content of the privacy policy.
- An algorithm will evaluate the policy based on a variety of key topics, including:
  - **Data Collection:** What data is being collected.
  - **Data Sharing:** If and how data is shared with third parties.
  - **Data Retention:** How long data is stored.
  - **User Rights:** The user's ability to access, edit, or delete their data.
  - **Data Security:** The measures taken to protect user data.
  - **Cookie Policy:** How cookies are used for tracking and advertising.
  - **Compliance:** Adherence to regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

### 3.3. Risk Score and Textual Representation
- A risk score from 1 to 5 will be assigned, with 5 being the safest and 1 being the riskiest.
- The scores will have the following textual representations:
    - 1: "Danger"
    - 2: "High Risk"
    - 3: "Moderate Risk"
    - 4: "Low Risk"
    - 5: "No Worry"

### 3.4. Detailed Breakdown
- The extension will present a detailed breakdown of the privacy policy analysis, categorized by key topics.
- Each topic (e.g., Data Sharing, User Rights) will be assigned a one-word rating: "Good", "Average", or "Poor".
- These topics will be displayed in an expandable accordion format. When expanded, each accordion will reveal the specific quote(s) from the privacy policy that led to the assigned rating, providing transparency and context for the assessment.

### 3.5. User Interface
- The risk score, textual representation, and summary of concerns will be displayed in the extension's UI.
- The UI will be user-friendly and easily accessible.

### 3.6. Algorithm and Weighting
- The scoring algorithm will use a weighted system to reflect the importance of different privacy factors. Key topics like **Data Sharing** and **User Rights** will have specific weights assigned to them to accurately calculate the final risk score.
- The algorithm should be designed to be adaptable for future updates.

### 3.7. Error Handling
- The extension will gracefully handle cases where a privacy policy cannot be accessed or analyzed, providing informative messages to the user.

### 3.8. Output Format
- The analysis results will be presented in a clear and understandable modal, allowing users to quickly assess a website's privacy risks.
